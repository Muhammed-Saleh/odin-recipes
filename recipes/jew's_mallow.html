    <h2>What is Molokhia?</h2>
        <p>
            Jute leaves/Jews mallow is a leafy green vegetable originating in Ancient Egypt,
            and found throughout the Middle East and North Africa.  
            The dish Molokhia is considered by many as the national dish of Egypt.
            The Egyptian version however, 
            differs greatly in texture and preparation from the Levantine version. 
            The Egyptian Molokhia is more soup-like and made with minced Molokhia.

    <h2>The recipe</h2>
    
    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
        <p>
            In a medium sized pot, heat one tablespoon of olive oil.
            Season the chicken breast with one teaspoon of salt and black pepper.
            Cook over high heat for about 2 minutes per side.
            Add the bay leaves, cloves, onion, remaining salt and about 6 cups of water.
            Cook on high heat until boiling,
            then lower the heat to medium and cook until chicken has cooked through, about 20-30 minutes.
            Set cooked chicken aside to cool. Once cooled, shred the chicken.

        <h3>STEP 2</h3>
        <p>
            Add 10 cups of the dried molokhia leaves to a large mixing bowl.
            Remove any stems or brown/yellow leaves.
            Heat up a kettle of water until just boiling, and pour over the leaves to re-hydrate them.
